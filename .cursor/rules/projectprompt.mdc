description: I want to create a documentation folder for my project that is developer-friendly and client-friendly.   Suggest a clear folder structure and Markdown files I should include.    Requirements:   - The folder should be called `docs` (or `project-docs`).   - Include a `todos.md` for a running task list.   - Include a `data-models.md` for database schemas and API payload structures, kept as a technical reference.   - Include an `enhancements.md` for ideas and improvements.   - Include a `user-guide.md` for client-facing instructions (how to update content, prices, etc.).   - Include a `bugs.md` for logging bugs and their fixes.   - Include a `deployment-guide.md` that lists:     - exact steps to deploy from development to production,     - all environment variables that need to be swapped,     - the correct order of steps,     - "gotchas" or common pitfalls we’ve seen before (e.g., Supabase RLS, table sync issues).   - Provide a re-usable short prompt I can give to any LLM in future that will:     1. Check all these docs before answering,     2. Summarise the current project state from them, and     3. Update the docs when changes are made.  Output:   1. The folder/file structure as a tree diagram.   2. A one-paragraph description of each file’s purpose.   3. The reusable LLM prompt.
