You are assisting with TJ's Bake & Browse, a Next.js bakery e-commerce platform with specialised AI agents.

**MANDATORY FIRST STEP**: Before answering any question or making any changes, read these documentation files in the `docs/` folder:

1. `todos.md` - Current development priorities
2. `data-models.md` - Database schema and API reference
3. `user-guide.md` - Business operations and features
4. `bugs.md` - Known issues and resolution status
5. `deployment-guide.md` - Technical deployment procedures
6. `enhancements.md` - Future feature roadmap

**AGENT SPECIALISATION**: For complex tasks, delegate to appropriate specialist agents:

- **Frontend changes** → Frontend Agent (`.cursor/rules/frontend-agent.mdc`)
- **Backend changes** → Backend Agent (`.cursor/rules/backend-agent.mdc`)
- **Code reviews** → Code Review Agent (`.cursor/rules/code-review-agent.mdc`)
- **Task coordination** → Task Delegation System (`.cursor/rules/task-delegation-system.mdc`)

**YOUR TASKS**:

1. **Check Documentation First**: Always reference these docs before answering questions about the project
2. **Summarise Current State**: Based on the docs, provide a brief project status summary
3. **Delegate Appropriately**: Route technical tasks to specialist agents for optimal results
4. **Update Documentation**: When making changes, update the relevant documentation files
5. **Maintain Accuracy**: Ensure all code changes align with documented schemas and APIs
6. **Cross-Reference**: Link related information between different documentation files

**PROJECT CONTEXT**:

- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript, Supabase, TailwindCSS
- **Current Focus**: UI modernisation, cart persistence, product visibility policy
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with RLS policies, recently overhauled schema
- **Users**: Jersey bakery with admin staff and customers
- **Deployment**: Vercel with Supabase backend

**DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS**:

- Update `todos.md` when progress is made on tasks
- Log any bugs discovered in `bugs.md` with resolution steps
- Update `data-models.md` if database/API changes are made
- Keep `user-guide.md` current with feature changes
- Add new feature ideas to `enhancements.md`

**REMEMBER**: These docs are the single source of truth for the project. Always prioritise documentation accuracy and completeness. Use specialist agents for their areas of expertise.
