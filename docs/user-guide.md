   - **Slot Duration**: 30-minute intervals
   - **Capacity**: 5 orders per slot (configurable)

   **How Operating Hours Are Controlled**:

   - Operating hours are currently **hardcoded in the application code**
   - Main configuration locations:
     - `/app/api/slots/route.ts` - Line 8: `generateSlots(now, 7, "09:00", "17:00", 30)`
     - `/lib/slots.ts` - Function parameters set opening/closing times
     - `/app/checkout/page.tsx` - Line 71: `buildSlots("09:00", "17:30", 30)`

   **Database Table Available (Not Yet Used)**:

   - A `business_hours` table exists in the database with configurable hours per day
   - This table is set up but not currently connected to the slot generation system
   - **Future Enhancement**: Connect this table to make hours easily configurable

2. **To Change Operating Hours (Current Method)**

   **‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Changing operating hours currently requires code changes and redeployment.

   **Steps Required**:

   1. **Contact your technical support team** - operating hours cannot be changed through the admin interface
   2. **Provide new hours** in this format:
      - Opening time: "HH:MM" (24-hour format, e.g., "08:30")
      - Closing time: "HH:MM" (24-hour format, e.g., "18:00")
      - Which days to operate (currently Monday-Saturday)
   3. **Development team will update**:
      - `/app/api/slots/route.ts` - Update the generateSlots parameters
      - `/lib/slots.ts` - Update default parameters if needed
      - `/app/checkout/page.tsx` - Update buildSlots parameters
      - Any other references to opening/closing times
   4. **Redeploy the application** for changes to take effect

3. **Slot Capacity Management**

   **Adjustable via Environment Variable**:

   - Slot capacity can be changed without code changes
   - Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SLOT_CAPACITY` environment variable
   - Default: 5 orders per time slot

4. **Slot Availability Rules**

   - **Cutoff Time**: Orders placed after 12:00 PM can only book slots from the next day onwards
   - **Sunday Closure**: All Sundays automatically disabled (hardcoded)

**‚úÖ Image URL Field Available**: You can now add image URLs directly through the admin interface!

**‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitation**: Direct image upload is not yet available. Images must be manually uploaded to the server first.

#### **Current Image Management Process**

1. **Image Requirements**:

   - **Size**: Minimum 400x400 pixels (recommended: 800x800 for high quality)
   - **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
   - **File size**: Under 2MB recommended
   - **Quality**: Good lighting and clear product visibility
   - **Style**: Consistent background preferred (white/neutral backgrounds work best)

2. **How to Add Product Images (Current Method)**:

   **Step 1: Prepare Your Images**

   - Resize images to at least 400x400 pixels
   - Optimise file size (under 2MB)
   - Name files descriptively (e.g., `sourdough-bread.jpg`, `chocolate-cookies.webp`)

   **Step 2: Upload to Server**

   - **Contact your technical support team** to upload images
   - Images need to be placed in `/public/images/products/` folder on the server
   - Technical team will provide you with the final URL path

   **Step 3: Add Image URL to Product**

   - Go to Admin Dashboard ‚Üí Inventory
   - Click "Edit Product" for an existing product, or create a new product
   - In the "Image URL" field, enter the path: `/images/products/your-image-name.jpg`
   - **Example**: `/images/products/sourdough-bread.jpg`
   - Click "Save Changes" to update the product

3. **Image URL Format**:

   - **Local images**: `/images/products/filename.jpg`
   - **External images**: `https://example.com/your-image.jpg` (if hosted elsewhere)
   - **Supabase storage**: `https://your-project.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/products/filename.jpg` (if configured)

4. **Troubleshooting Image Issues**:
   - **Image not showing**: Check the exact file path and spelling
   - **Broken image icon**: Verify the image file exists in the correct folder
   - **Slow loading**: Optimise image file size
   - **Wrong size**: Check image dimensions are at least 400x400 pixels

#### **üöß Planned Enhancement: Direct Image Upload**

**Future features being developed**:

- Direct image upload through admin interface
- Automatic image resizing and optimisation
- Multiple images per product
- Drag-and-drop image management
- Integration with Supabase storage for reliable hosting

**Current Workaround**:
Until the upload feature is implemented, you'll need to coordinate with technical support for new product images. Have your images ready and properly named to streamline this process.

#### **Best Practices for Product Images**
