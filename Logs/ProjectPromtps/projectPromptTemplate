"I'm continuing development on TJ's Bake & Browse, a Next.js bakery website with Supabase backend.

CRITICAL: Use these files as source of truth:

- to-dos.md - Main task list (17/35 completed, 48.6% complete)
- Logs/02_BUG_TRACKING_LOG.md - Bug tracking & recent implementations
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md - Development phases & strategy

PROJECT CONTEXT:

- Bakery website with admin inventory, customer ordering, time slot booking
- Next.js App Router, Supabase, TailwindCSS, TypeScript
- Test pages in /test-styling/ directory for design review
- Recent: Suggestions form, admin orders time filtering, site-wide button styling

DEVELOPMENT APPROACH:

- Read core documents to understand current state
- Check to-dos.md for next priority tasks
- Follow existing file structure and UK English conventions
- Test pages first, then apply to live site

IMMEDIATE ACTION:

1. Review the three core documents
2. Identify next priority task from to-dos.md
3. Plan and execute next development step
4. Update tracking files as work progresses

Start by reading the core documents, then proceed with the next priority task.""
