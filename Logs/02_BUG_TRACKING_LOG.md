### BUG-001: Admin Inventory - Product Name Update Not Working

**Date Identified:** [Current Date]  
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Admin functionality broken - cannot update product names  
**Description:** Product name updates in admin inventory dashboard are not working properly. This prevents admin users from maintaining accurate product information.  
**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Log in as admin
2. Go to admin/inventory
3. Try to update a product name
4. Save changes
5. Observe that changes are not persisted

**Expected Behavior:** Product name should update and save successfully  
**Actual Behavior:** Product name update fails silently or doesn't persist  
**Environment:** Production/Development  
**Browser/Device:** All  
**Additional Notes:** Test update category/allergies functionality as well to see if this is a broader issue with the update system

**Root Cause Analysis:** PATCH endpoint missing `name` field handling. The frontend sends the name but the API doesn't process it in the updates object.  
**Resolution Plan:** Add name field handling to the PATCH method in `/api/admin/inventory/route.ts`  
**Estimated Fix Time:** 0.5-1 hour  
**Assigned To:** [To be assigned]  
**Target Resolution Date:** [To be set]

**Resolution Date:** [Current Date]  
**Resolution Method:** Added name field handling to PATCH method in `/api/admin/inventory/route.ts`  
**Code Changes:**

- Added `name` to request body destructuring
- Added validation for name field (must be non-empty string)
- Added name updates to the updates object
  **Testing:** Development server started successfully, no syntax errors  
  **Lessons Learned:** Always ensure all fields from request body are properly destructured and handled in API endpoints
