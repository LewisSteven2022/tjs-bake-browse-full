### 2024 - Comprehensive Button Styling Update ‚úÖ RESOLVED

**Date**: Current Session  
**Type**: Enhancement/Standardisation  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

**Description**:
Site-wide button and input field styling was inconsistent, with mixed use of `rounded-lg`, `rounded-xl`, gradients, and various color schemes. This created visual inconsistency and reduced the professional appearance of the application.

**Root Cause**:

- Gradual development over time led to inconsistent styling patterns
- Different developers/approaches used various button styles
- No established design system for button components

**Solution Implemented**:

- **Standardised Button Styling**: All buttons now use `rounded-full` with consistent blue color scheme (`bg-blue-800 hover:bg-blue-700`)
- **Input Field Consistency**: All form inputs use `rounded-full border` styling
- **Component Updates**: Updated 20+ files across main pages, admin pages, test pages, and components
- **Color Scheme Unification**: Replaced gradients and mixed colors with consistent blue palette

**Files Modified**:

- Main application pages (Homepage, Login, Register, Basket, Checkout, Order Success)
- Admin management pages (Orders, Products, Inventory)
- Test and styling pages (Notifications, Scroll dismissal, Styling variations)
- Core components (NavAuth, PremiumNotification, ProductCard)

**Testing Performed**:

- ‚úÖ Build verification completed successfully
- ‚úÖ All button styles updated consistently
- ‚úÖ Input field styling standardised
- ‚úÖ Visual consistency achieved across all pages

**Result**:

- **Visual Consistency**: Unified button appearance throughout the application
- **Professional Look**: Clean, modern rounded design matching site aesthetic
- **User Experience**: Consistent interaction patterns across all pages
- **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain and update button styles in future

**Prevention**:

- Established consistent design patterns for future development
- Documented styling standards in Learning Material
- All new buttons should follow the established `rounded-full` pattern

## üö® CRITICAL BUGS (Active)

### BUG-001: Admin Inventory - Product Name Update Not Working

**Date Identified:** [Current Date]  
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Admin functionality broken - cannot update product names  
**Description:** Product name updates in admin inventory dashboard are not working properly. This prevents admin users from maintaining accurate product information.  
**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Log in as admin
2. Go to admin/inventory
3. Try to update a product name
4. Save changes
5. Observe that changes are not persisted

**Expected Behavior:** Product name should update and save successfully  
**Actual Behavior:** Product name update fails silently or doesn't persist  
**Environment:** Production/Development  
**Browser/Device:** All  
**Additional Notes:** Test update category/allergies functionality as well to see if this is a broader issue with the update system

**Root Cause Analysis:** PATCH endpoint missing `name` field handling. The frontend sends the name but the API doesn't process it in the updates object.  
**Resolution Plan:** Add name field handling to the PATCH method in `/api/admin/inventory/route.ts`  
**Estimated Fix Time:** 0.5-1 hour  
**Assigned To:** [To be assigned]  
**Target Resolution Date:** [To be set]

**Resolution Date:** [Current Date]  
**Resolution Method:** Added name field handling to PATCH method in `/api/admin/inventory/route.ts`  
**Code Changes:**

- Added `name` to request body destructuring
- Added validation for name field (must be non-empty string)
- Added name updates to the updates object
  **Testing:** Development server started successfully, no syntax errors  
  **Lessons Learned:** Always ensure all fields from request body are properly destructured and handled in API endpoints

**Testing Performed**:

- ‚úÖ Urgent order highlighting verified with red backgrounds and badges
