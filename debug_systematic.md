# üîç Systematic Debugging Plan

## Current Observations from Terminal Logs

1. ‚úÖ **PATCH requests ARE successful** (200 status, lines 171 & 190)
2. ‚ùå **Image 404 errors**: `/admin/public/images/products/chocCookies.jpg` (wrong path!)
3. ‚úÖ **Products API is being called** after PATCH (lines 177-178)

## Issues Identified

### 1. Image Path Problem

- **Log shows**: `/admin/public/images/products/chocCookies.jpg 404`
- **Wrong path**: `/admin/public/` prefix shouldn't be there
- **Correct path should be**: `/images/products/chocCookies.jpg`

### 2. Need to verify database state

- PATCH returns 200, but we need to confirm what's actually in the database

## Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Check Current Database State

```bash
# What does the API return right now?
curl -s "http://localhost:3000/api/products" | jq '.products[] | select(.name | contains("Chocolate"))'
```

### Step 2: Check What Admin Dashboard Shows

```bash
# Note: This requires authentication, so check in browser
# /admin/inventory - what does it show for price and image_url?
```

### Step 3: Verify Image Path Logic

- Check what image URL you're entering in admin
- Verify the path format is correct
- Check if image file actually exists

### Step 4: Test Manual Database Update

If admin save is working but data isn't updating, there might be:

- Multiple database connections
- Cache issues
- Transaction rollbacks

## Immediate Tests

1. **Check products API response**
2. **Verify admin inventory shows updated values**
3. **Test with correct image path format**
4. **Check browser Network tab for exact request/response**

## Next Steps Based on Findings

If database shows old values ‚Üí Admin save is broken
If database shows new values ‚Üí Customer API transformation is broken
If image path is wrong ‚Üí Fix image URL input format
